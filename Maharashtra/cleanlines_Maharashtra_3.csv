Review,Rating
 One was 1600 rupees and had cockroaches literally just running about on the bed; the guy just shrugged when I pointed that out.,0
" I just wish I felt as clean as my sleeper having for the second time in a row,",0
The hotel was pretty dirty and crusty and I'm sharing a dorm in it as it was the cheapest place I could find with a central location close to the sights.,1
 there are just 700 toilets for half a million people that are only cleaned weekly.,1
026 concrete baths and about the same number of dhobis getting through much of Mumbai's dirty laundry.,1
 We had eggless waffles and delicious fresh juices and organic teas.,0
" India always has a smell; whether it's sewage,",1
 unlike here in Northern India) and the toilet was a squat one.,0
" clean and welcoming sanctuary for a weary traveller,",1
 The smell of all the herbs was really nice though.,1
 Revenir holidays had a pretty good swimming pool (though not very clean still good enough) and we took our time there to make full use of the facility.,1
 That rule has gone a long way in keeping the place pollution free and maintaining the forest in its original state.,1
 The place was very clean and the idols were very beautifully crafted.,1
 Lonavala has become pretty crowded with more and more tourists while Matheran has been able to maintain a pollution free forest like environment.,1
 This again as always led to us calling our trek organizer umpteen number of times before finalizing the exact number.,1
 the gym guy was helpful again but trying to get me to change to a new programme and I was like no… I am happy with this one and as I’m only here for another day I’m not sure your one will really be helpful to me… I arrived back in the room to get ready for work to find the attendant about to clean it… I asked him to wait 30 minutes until I left.,0
" Surprisingly this shabby train with dirty windows and toilet rated highly on the India railways survey,",1
 confirming that standards of cleanliness are entirely relative.,1
 as my taxi entered in Colaba I could finally breathe & smell the sea.,1
 It has been made worse by a fire at a rubbish dump.,0
 clean and friendly hotel.,1
 They had great vegan and organic food.,1
 clean and peaceful place.,1
 The smell was all that ""stuck"" to us.,1
 The driver quickly ""cleaned"" it with a little bit of water.,0
 After 3 shaking hours there was a short toilet stop (which we thankfully did not need!,1
 It is not so very well maintained as the Taj Mahal but still some effort is put into the gardens and the building.,1
After a wonderful night in a clean bed and a quiet room we had breakfast in our room (strange for us but popular in India - and it was included and really tasty).,0
 Add more trash and refuse to an already over-populated landscape?,0
 desperate for the toilet only too find the most disgusting ones I have ever seen in my entire life.,1
" One row were squat toilets and the only were normal,",1
 lovely water and the awesomely maintained streets.,1
 I had to go to the toilet and I crossed the street to use a public toilet on the corner.,0
 They had some urinals there and the stench was unbearable.,1
 ever smelled such a bad urine odour before!,1
" This company organizes walking tours through Dharavi,",1
 On the right there were kids playing cricket but the field had a lot of garbage laying around.,0
 A whole disorganized block of shacks and houses made of inadequate material and roofs full of plastic and other rubbish is what your eyes will be seeing when standing on that bridge.,0
" dirty water flows along the streets at some parts,",1
 children walking bare feet and playing close to a pile of garbage just behind their house.,0
 Harihareshwar gram panchyat has made good efforts to make beach and its surrounding look like Mumbai chowpati and have tried to maintain thru Modi’s swachta abhiyan campaign.,1
" Rooms were clean and hygienic,",1
 My Fiesta was ready with half tank full and wind shields clean from dust!,1
" but it was clean (and if you wish they clean daily),",0
 It is like a rat race.,0
" Rats (really huge ones) were running along the streets,",0
" it is fascinating - but it is definitely a rat race,",0
 but not as clean as I would like to feel!,1
 has a very few stoppages and is clean and well maintained.,1
 well maintained shul in Alibag.,1
 but we found out after that it was very hard to clean and wipe off.,1
Hotel Oberoi is a very basic clean hotel which seems to have started only couple of years ago.,1
 Its not maintained well at all.,1
" and dirtiness that is Mumbai,",1
 For us guys at least we have 2 banks of urinals to use in addition to a few stalls.,0
hard time maintaining my composure.,1
"Clean rooms,",1
" the litter and rubbish everywhere,",1
We cleaned up and went out to explore the city.,0
 I had my sandals cleaned and fixed by a shoe shine guy.,0
 and of course once again crammed to the hilt – I wish I could transport you all for the sounds and smells (ok so some of the smells not that great) often of burning incense which can only mean two things food stalls or temples.,0
" I have to say the tidal line is also incredibly clean and one I find remarkable as the rest of the beach,",1
 It might all change when the monsoon comes and all the rubbish from the fishing boats comes floating in and all the rubbish on the land gets washed into the sea.,0
Today my mother and I had breakfast as usual and took a walk around the smaller areas around the hotel to drop off some dry cleaning and ended up in a very residential area.,1
" smells (good and bad),",1
 Chowpatty beach also seems to be a popular place for waste disposal and the shallows were thick with rubbish and sewage.,0
" or the smell of the vast contrast between rich and poor,",0
 and despite the torrential downpour along the appallingly maintained main highway to Ajanta we were ready to make our own minds up to which we preferred.,0
 it’s clean and it has the most amazing view.,1
 I buy a can and fill up the hot spring water which smells like sulphur.,0
 A shaktipeeth is where the organs of the goddess sati fell.,1
 Lord shiv’s consort sati went to the yajna organized by her father against the willingness of lord shiv.,0
 and wherever her organ fell a shaktipeeth arose.,0
" the clean blue water,",0
Just a pinch of the rubbish by the railway tracks.,1
 smells and heat all at once.,1
 I don’t think we will ever forget some of the sad things we have seen here from babies crawling through the rubbish to a guy with a severed foot covered in flies just sitting on the street seemingly waiting for the end.,0
" Pune is green and clean and still developing,",1
 It was awful dirty small room for outrageous price as the owner could see how desperate we were.,0
have and eat from dirty plates with their hands.,0
" To me it just seems dirty and wrong,",1
 and the littering is plain lazy.,1
" It’s advertised on the city tours etc as a place to go but it’s littered with homeless people and plastic bottles,",0
 We will be assigned random tasks through out our stay here but for today we just have to clean up our rooms.,1
 I eventually cleaned my plate that looked as if it had been licked clean and headed over to our main building were we were to do introductions.,0
 and cockroach intrusion.,0
 I may blend in with this shirt but it restricts my movements just a smidge and well is still dirty from the last time I wore it.,0
Karma yoga time was next and I wish I had been on tea so I could you know work out but a las I was not so instead I was assigned to clean the main hall.,0
 mop and clean outside.,1
As the cleaning crew finished up the room the bell rang and we made our way over.,0
My karma yoga for the day was to clean the library.,0
 Two of us to clean one small room.,1
I had to clean toilets for karma yoga which may not sound that great but with three people cleaning a tiny area we were done with time to spare.,0
 Cherry and I cleaned outside the office and my micro lesson where I got all nervous once more.,1
" cleaning the room,",1
 I took so many pictures of the kids jumping in the water and women cleaning clothes.,0
Karma yoga was cleaning the library today.,0
 It was as of they were all in silence making the whole cleaning thing quite boring.,1
Doing a round of netti to clean out our nasal passages we called it a morning and we sent to eat breakfast.,1
Once again I was instructed to clean the main hall.,1
" it is a tall building and very well maintained and also has the Sassoon Children's school,",1
" The dhobi is a traditional laundry man who collects peoples dirty linen,",1
 The Hanging Gardens are actually a lovely park with well-maintained gardens over a reservoir.,1
 and it wasn't as dirty or smelly as people had made out (except for by the slums).,0
 which is this pool of clean fresh water that Pratik said nobody knew where the water truly comes from.,0
 dirty and full of smells.,1
" Despite the unnaturally large rats on the tracks,",0
 but the smell of fish.,1
 even if the stench of fish in the 30 degree heat isn't the nicest smell either.,0
" dodging rats and excrement,",0
 Every single piece of scrap material or rubbish had been collected and was being laoriously sub-divded into towering piles of colourful trash on either side of the street.,0
" friendly and clean (""""India clean"""",",1
 a delightful small and tidy place overlooking the sea.,1
 In spite of being the largest population in the world I could observed that they were polite and a little more organized and less rude than their fellow Chinese neighbors.,1
 I could tell that it was a well organized airport.,0
" Anyway the ride continue through neighborhoods low class and slums with garbage everywhere and the smells,",0
 Luckily for me no one was there because it turned out to be a mix man and woman bathroom although it did have separate toilets and shower rooms for man and woman.,1
" but in a smaller dimension with an open window to get the food and another one to put dirty plates and a table where the food,",0
 The only problem I found was that after the massage my hair was so oily and it was really hard to get it cleaned without hot water.,0
 but very well maintained and they all seemed to be owned by a middle class family.,1
 We tried a fourth more local hotel and the had space but it was a cramped style and not terrible well maintained or cleaned.,0
 I organized the taxi to the airport the next morning for 500.,0
 recycling trash from within the city and beyond; both the USA and China send their rubbish here.,1
" along dark and narrow garbage-strewn alleyways flowing with often open-sewers,",0
" up steep steel staircases to corrugated roofs scattered with yesterday's rubbish and kids playing cricket,",0
 but it is equally reality that these seemingly happy people are cleaning up this world we contiue to pollute with our consumer driven trash.,1
 cleans them inside and out and sprays them with red oxide paint to be reprinted with another brand name and refilled.,1
 there are places where open sewers scent the air and rubbish sits in piles waiting never to be collected.,0
 as there are reports of a tiger being spotted not far away from the Fort by workers cleaning it up the day before.,1
After brief visit and blessing at the shrine and a look around the surrounding village – a pretty run down and dirty place - we make a quick trip (thanks to all the midges) to see the large dam built near the town – which in part explains why it’s so dusty- then head to see some gardens which have a children’s adventure park – to tire Soham out.,1
" They reluctantly swap S’s room to one someone has just vacated and they proceed to just tidy the bed – no sheet change etc,",1
" We stop to clean up - the culprit,",1
so dirty and traffic congested as other cities and many of the neighbourhoods – such as where Shobha lives – are very pleasant with neighbourhood shops and facilities.,1
 and a rat sharing dinner out of the same garbage bag.,0
The swastika maintains its original message of goodness.,1
"organization called Point of View which does some very interesting work around women's sexual safety,",0
 the woman who started the organization which we will be working with for the next 11 days.,0
"only will we run the group with the 22 girls she has organized to work with us (who are between 11-17 years of age) but we will also be interviewing her,",1
 and she will organize one of the women's meetings she facilitates each month.,1
 I will be working with an organization named Aseeema.,1
 Aseema is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children receieve an education who do not have the opportunity.,1
 You may be thinking: India has free education for all citizens why is a non-profit organization needed to ensure education for children?,1
 The Aseema organization's webpage talks about the difficulty they had when first trying to teach the children in a classroom setting.,1
 But eventually the kids loved to learn and the organization has expanded from the 18 children it began teaching to 1500 children.,0
 I volunteered through a non-profit organization called Yofafo (Youth Focus Africa Foundation).,1
 This organization was started by a man named Valence.,1
 The East India Company again took over India in 1820 and maintained this control until 1947 when India gained its independence.,1
 ""His home sat midway down a row of hand-built spatchcrock dwellings; the lopsided shed where he stowed his trash was just next door.,1
 I can easily visualize this child Abdul hiding from these cops (the rest of the prolouge describes it in great detail it is hard to not paint a mental image of a child hiding on trash heaps next to his hut).,0
 You see beggers on the streets and trash everywhere.,1
 the bathrooms and the smells of Kibera.,1
 On the other hand you have slums like Annawadi where people make their money scavenging through the trash of nearby luxurious hotels.,1
 These people collect the trash of these richer people and trek all the way back to their slum to go to sleep in a hut they share with too many family members.,1
 smells and interesting people.,1
" the gift shop maintained the overall ambience of the building,",0
 the architecture and stained glass of the booking hall.,1
" the litter is appalling,",1
" the smells gut wrenching,",1
" yet Indians still manage to maintain their own culture and way of life,",1
 excrement (human and dog alike) and dead rats in varying stages of decay.,0
 feces and rat carcass.,0
 and clean water.,1
" another person clean your floors,",0
I think it had very good infrastructure but could be maintained better.,1
 we will read in press and medie that most of the other forts are maintained poorly.,0
 2 things I can think of is Tabak Udyan which a garden maintained at the mouth of vally within the fort and the way they have encourged local people to set up their food shops and stalls for the visitors.,1
its a nicely maintained temple on top of which the idol sits.,0
Just 5 mins drive from the backwaters it is very well maintained for hygene & service.,1
 (where the toilet somehow got plugged **cough**Jonny**cough**.,0
" where I made friends with the staff and the toilet remained unplugged,",1
 and who we made a deal with to come cook dinner and clean for us 6 days a week (for cheap too!,0
 Clean/modern/compact and very air conditioned.,1
 masses of big black crows filled the sky and cocky rats would stroll around confidently feasting of the heads of animal corpses.,0
fish coupled with the rats meant that we didn’t stay in the meat section for to long.,0
 I approached cautiously and was instantly approached by a hoard of laughing children running bare foot through the sewage and littered streets.,1
" the strong smells (sometimes of the great street food and others of open sewerage),",1
" my trousers dirty and my elbow bloody,",0
 I stepped off the plane to a huge wave of humidity and a strong smell of the memory of my grandparents luggage from every time they came back from India.,1
" South Mumbai seems really clean and modern,",0
 and garbage heaps.,1
" dirty water,",1
" clean beach without the maddening crowds,",1
 the sand clean and the beach is quite long too.,0
By sunset on the clean sands.,0
 extremely clean and well maintained .,0
 clean air with the redolence of flora around & the unburdening atmosphere.,1
" Poor sanitationAs more than 122 million households have no toilets and 33% lack access to latrines,",0
" great to have the added space in business class especially with all the smells & people did seem to like to clear their throats which was disgusting,",1
 I was a bit anxious at first and the Camel smelled pretty bad.,1
2) It had to be a place with clean beaches and very few people.,1
 The pain is coming off the walls and the damp old smell lingers in the air.,1
 visit two toilets and have a slice of apple crumble with mango juice.,1
The toilets feature a small hose next to the toilet itself.,1
 the indian toilet wash device.,1
 Luckily there is toilet paper too.,1
 Let’s just say the person who got her muddy didn’t remain clean for long.,0
 The tracks were polluted with garbage and bodily fluids and the rats here are the size of large cats.,0
 The church also had several stunning stained glass windows.,1
 western toilets and spectacular bedrooms).,1
 Each of us are starting to feel the reality of long travel and lack of sleep but none would deny that we are eager to get our hands dirty and get whooped at cricket!,0
 so Padraic went and used the toilet and I waited in the lobby.,0
 he will later show his immense respect for his heritage by urinating outside one of the caves.,1
 otherwise they would smell like piss as well.,0
 get truly clean and eat some beef (probably buffalo) for the first time in about six weeks.,0
 The general state of the roadsides and pavements doesn’t help the impression of the city and the lack of any obvious litter-clearing provision.,0
" There were posters up saying “Keep our city clean and green” but if the authorities don’t provide bins,",1
" The toilets were predictably grim but having been forewarned by a very well-travelled Mumbai lady on the plane from London we were armed with tissues,",0
 I estimate the intensity of the ""lub"" and the ""dub"" (heart sounds) and do my best to organize my thoughts to formulate my own diagnosis.,0
India recently achieved a major milestone that was lauded by health care organizations around the globe.,1
 indicating that major efforts by the World Health Organization (featured in one of Atul Gawande's books) and the Indian government were bearing fruit.,1
"6) Rat poison suicide attempt - apparently,",0
 Despite the early start I made sure to get up in time to take a shower as I was all too aware that I would be smelling and feeling pretty savage after 4 days without a shower.,1
 Ancient abandoned and ruined temples littered the landscape much as tin mines do at home in Cornwall.,0
 Another privilege of bush camping is bush toileting aka digging your own toilet with a spade.,0
 Saying that it beat using most of the squalid squat toilets we stopped at throughout the day.,1
The way out there was disgracefully smoggy – even with handkerchief over my nose and mouth I could smell and taste the burnt petroleum (and probably cow dung if I knew what that tasted like!,1
 and the room tidied for the evening by yet another man.,1
" crawling with baby cockroaches (babies,",0
 I'm not sure what for but I can't help but think about the rest of India having rubbish strewn about the place but in the slums there seems to be a place for everything.,0
" smells that slap you in the face with either disgust or delight,",0
" the lesser the people and the more the unbelievable smell of garbage,",1
 urine and everything else under that category.,0
" with people sleeping on the dirty streets,",1
 a real local Character named after Sammy Davis Jr from the Rat Pack he said (!,1
 which was ok but the water didn't look very clean to swim in!,1
 In fairness the bus wasn't new but it was reasonably modern - just not all that clean and maybe a little warworn.,0
 If it were my choice I would have taken the luggage compartment anyway instead of canoodling a 120kg hairy sweety man that smelled like curry.,0
Sorry no photos for all of the above - didn't really get organized for this one.,0
 We've finally noticed a smell but our car windows have been open so that explains that.,1
 It was so much fun to watch the lady do her thing and the henna smells yummy.,1
